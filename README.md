## About the Game

This is a user friendly game with pretty cool background and snake colour. The snake speed increases upto certain limit after the start of the game. First a starting screen will open where user has to press space to start the game and then the game will start. The snake length increases by one as soon as the snake eats the food which will be in the grid and the score is calculate based on that. After the game is over which is when the snake hits the boundaries of the grid( i.e. any of the four boundaries) or it hits own body, the score is shown along with the high score till now. User can press space of enter based upon the choice he/she wish to restart the game or exit respectively.
